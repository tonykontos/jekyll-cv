# Profile
profile: |
  My name is Antonis Kontonasis, and I am a graduate of the Department of Computer Engineering at the University of Ioannina. 
  After my graduation, I started working as a web developer. 
  The nature of the job often led me to explore web design as well, and it's something I've been wanting to delve into more and improve upon lately. 
  That's why I chose to participate in the postgraduate program in Human-Computer Interaction.
